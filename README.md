# Refactoring Chp 6
* Collection of examples/practice to work as a companion to chapter 6.
* These are very contrived and overly simplistic. Stay focused on the refactoring.

## Requirements
* node
* npm

## Install
* clone repo
* run `npm install` on parent directory.

## Run Tests
* `npm test` or `yarn test`

### Test Notes
* Tests are fairly crude but get the job done.
* There are tests to verify each refactoring. In most cases you won't have to update tests.
* `Encapsulate Variable` uses test as client so it will need updates.
* `Extract Variable` test case is failing!! Will be fixed by doing the exercise..
